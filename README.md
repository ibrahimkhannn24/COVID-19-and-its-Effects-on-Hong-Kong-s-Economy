# COVID-19-and-its-Effects-on-Hong-Kong-s-Economy
This project analyses the dynamics between COVID-19 and its effects on Hong Kong’s economy using data from 2019–2023. Through a Tableau storyboard, we visualised economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Unemployment Rate to tell a story of resilience amidst adversity. The storyboard illustrates the journey from economic downturns caused by the pandemic to gradual recovery, evidenced by improving indicators.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Sources:**
  - Unemployment (Census and Statistics Department)
  - GDP (Census and Statistics Department)
  - CPI (Census and Statistics Department)
  - COVID-19 Cases (DATA.GOV.HK)
    
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Removed irrelevant data (e.g., gender-segregated unemployment figures).
  - Focused on 2019–2023 data using Excel functions.
  - Cleaned datasets for effective Tableau visualisation.
    
- **Visualisation Approach:**
  - Used a red theme with black backgrounds for contrast.
  - Line graphs (e.g., COVID cases, unemployment) to highlight trends.
  - Bar graphs (e.g., GDP, CPI) to clearly show year-on-year changes.
  - Cohesive design with clear labels and icons for user-friendly navigation.
    
**Key Insights:**
Unemployment, GDP, and CPI trends reveal the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19, while recovery patterns show resilience. The COVID-19 reported cases correlate with economic indicators, providing a holistic view of the pandemic’s impact on Hong Kong’s economy.
